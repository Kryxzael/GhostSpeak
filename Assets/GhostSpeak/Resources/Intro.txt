::notScary
	@ghost
	/angry
	Well, I think it's super scary...
	-
	
	@ghost
	/normal
	When I'm scared I don't 
	like to be alone

	@ghost
	/happy
	Do you want to play a game with me?
	> I do! -> play
	> Not really... -> comeOn

	@ghost
	/sad
	The other ghosts make fun of me 
	when I say I'm scared...

	@ghost
	/normal
	Hey, do you know what I like 
	to do when I'm anxious? 
	-
	
	@ghost
	/happy
	I like to play games. 
	Do you want to play with me?
	
	> No... -> comeOn
	> I do! -> play

::comeOn
	@ghost
	/sad
	Please? It's really fun
	> No -> comeOn
	> Okay -> play

	/happy
	Yay! Okay! I'll teach you
	the rules!
	-
	
	@ghost
	Okay, so...
	-
	
	@ghost
	I'm going to talk in my 
	native language, #rBoo-speak#w!
	-
	
	@ghost
	I'll tell you what your 
	#rtoys#w are named in boo
	-
	
	@ghost
	Just click them
	and I'll tell you its name
	-
	
	@ghost
	That way you can #rlearn the
	letters#w
	-
	
	@ghost
	Then you try to #rtranslate
	my word!#w
	-
	
	@ghost
	Okay! Let's go!
